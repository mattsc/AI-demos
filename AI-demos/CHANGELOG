----- 0.14.1 -----

- Fred (Freelands AI for Northerners, Side 1):
  - Refinements to the attack / counter attack evaluations:
    - Most notably, we now take the time when "delayed damage" (poison, slow,
      but also healing etc.) are applied into account correctly, and do not
      double count the chance to die of units (both own and enemy). These
      changes result in a significant improvement to the accuracy of the
      attack evaluation.
    - Significantly decrease evaluation time in situations when there are
      many AI and enemy units close to each other
    - Defend leader more aggressively
    - Add or improve consideration of the following in max damage calculations:
      - Berserk, backstab, drain, magical, marksman, plague
      - Immunities to poison, drain, plague
      - Also apply these to the defender (previously was done only for attacker)
    - Remove enemy starting damage bonus
    - Do not give trapping bonus for already trapped enemies
    - Do not discard a potential attack based on the forward attack rating alone
    - Take fearless trait into account for time of day modifier
    - Take healthy trait into account for delayed damage calculation
    - Stop and reconsider attack combo execution if an attacker dies
  - Do not abandon leader in face of large enemy force
  - Improve advancing (rating and direction) toward own and enemy leader
  - Evaluate acceptable holding/advancing positions slightly more conservatively
  - Add 'remove_MP' candidate action: this sometimes makes Fred execute a few
    more attacks at turn end, as attacks are evaluated differently for units
    with and without MP
  - Fred scenario:
    - Remove warning when playing against undead
    - Use random start time
    - Remove "kill unit" custom menu item
    - No scrolling to Fred for end-of-scenario message
- Miscellaneous:
  - Quite a bit of internal reorganization of functions and tables


----- 0.14.0, 22 August 2014 -----

- Fred (Freelands AI for Northerners, Side 1):
  - Complete overhaul with huge changes to both the overall strategy and the
    individual actions, as well as to many of the utility functions
  - AI id renamed from 'grunt_rush_Freelands' to 'fred', as it really is not a
    grunt rush any more
  - Reintroduce restriction that Fred can only play Northerners. This is
    technically not necessary, but I want to concentrate on that faction for now.
    This restriction will be removed again later.
  - Lift fog at beginning of MP game if it is on. This is also a temporary
    measure for testing right now.
  - Set name and id of side leader to 'Fred' in MP game
  - Add menus at SP scenario start to choose human player/AI and enemy gold
  - Have Fred's messages show up in both MP game and SP scenario
  - Add some trash talk easter eggs
- Fast Micro AI:
  - New version that uses fred_attack_utils and gamestate functions rather than
    battle_calcs.lua. This is faster in many cases.
- High XP Attack Micro AI:
  - Added first version of an AI that deals with attacks on enemy units that are
    very close to leveling
- Test scenario:
  - New flag 'exec_loop'
- Miscellaneous:
  - Rename the AIs in the MP setup menus
  - All AIs: don't include mainline AI macros if they have already been loaded
  - ai_helper: only display checked action error message in debug mode
  - Many other changes, some visible, some internal. See git repository for details.


----- 0.13.3, 20 June 2014 -----

- Fix for bug that prematurely ended the game in rare cases when the enemy
  has units with the hides ability


----- 0.13.2, 19 June 2014 -----

- Another bug fix release:
  - Fix a couple bugs in Fred that sometimes caused the AI to crash (with one of
    them even ending the game sometimes)
  - Limit number of counter attack combos considered in order to speed things up again
    after the change in attack evaluation in 0.13.1


----- 0.13.1, 18 June 2014 -----

- Main reason for this release: fix for a serious bug in Fred's attack evaluation that
  made Fred do extremely suicidal moves when an enemy unit was close to leveling up
- Other changes (some of them still work in progress):
  - Fred: Tuning of evaluation functions to improve playing of factions other
    than Northerners
  - Fred: Take counter attack rating into account in picking the best attack (this
    makes evaluation times a little longer, but should result in better attacks)
  - Fred: full offensive mode is now done by Fred, not left to the RCA AI any
    more (this is still work in progress)
  - retreat.lua: a variety of bug fixes, ensuring that injured units do, in fact,
    always go to villages or hexes adjacent to healers if possible
  - Miscellaneous performance improvements, minor bug fixes and code cleanup to
    Fred and helper libraries


----- 0.13.0, 12 June 2014 -----

- *** This is an abbreviated changelog since it has been so long since the last release ***
  - Only major (general) changes are summarized, without details about the specifics
  - Check out the AI-demos github site for all the details
- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush (Fred)
  - Fred has been completely overhauled. Pretty much all parts of Fred were rewritten twice,
    once to improve behavior and then again to increase evaluation speed. In the process,
    many bugs were fixed.
  - There is a new Fred test scenario that can be started from the switchboard scenario or
    from the command line with ‘wesnoth -t fred’
  - In honor of the “new Fred”, the minor version number of this release is changed to 13
- Helper libraries:
  - ai_helper:
    - New functions get_units_with_moves(), get_units_with_attacks(), checked_attack(), checked_move_full(),
      checked_move(), checked_recruit(), checked_stopunit_all(), checked_stopunit_attacks(),
      checked_stopunit_moves(), get_direction_index(), get_cardinal_directions(),
      get_intercardinal_directions(), get_hex_facing(), put_fgumap_labels()
    - Removed ai_helper.random()
  - battle_calcs: largely rewritten, but not used in Fred any more. Instead we now have:
  - New helper libraries fred_attack_utils, fred_gamestate_utils, fred_gamestate_utils_incremental
- Generic recruit engine:
  - Add option to evaluate pre-recruiting at another castle reachable on the current turn
- All AIs and helper functions:

----- 0.12.1, 2 Dec 2012 -----

- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush (Fred):
  - Adjusted time-of-day dependent cycles so that they work for any unit/faction
    - They are now based on relative damage that AI and enemy units can do, rather than on the alignment per se
    - This makes Fred better at playing lawful factions, but he's still not very good at it, at least not against Northerners
  - A number of small adjustments to the attack/move evaluation functions

  - Identical to v0.11.2, except for the "this is the last 1.10 release" messages


----- 0.11.2, 12 Oct 2012 -----

- ***** Important Note: This will be the last release of AI-Demos for Wesnoth 1.10 *****
  - Some of the next steps required at this point will only be possible with the new capabilities of BfW 1.11
  - Except for potential bug fixes, this will therefore be the last release of AI-Demos for Wesnoth 1.10
  - Further development will only be done for Wesnoth 1.11 and later; this will _not_ be backward compatible
  - We will make sure to use only capabilities of released versions of 1.11 (currently 1.11.0), so no compiling of trunk will be necessary
- Generic Rush:
  - New recruit algorithm, incl.:
    - Know about drain not affecting undead units
- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush:
  - New zone_control CA (completely reworked how several of the CAs function)
    - Works on a zone-by-zone basis, rather than map-wide
    - Several of the old CAs were combined into zone_control, acting in a more coordinated way (within a zone) in this way
    - This includes some changes to behavior, but nothing earth shattering
    - A bunch of bug fixes going along with that
    - Units are now sent into zones to capture villages, if there aren't enough units already
      - This is particularly important for the NW villages

    - Only show real evaluation functions in menu
    - Debugger now gives error message if used with Side 2 (instead of crashing Wesnoth)
    - Selected CA name is now shown in right-click menu

  - New recruit algorithm
    - Can counter recruit
    - Recruits scouts based on map size
    - Can handle multiple allies and opponents
    - Should work with any faction (though non-standard abilities may not be accounted for or mishandled)
  - No longer freezes when trying to poison units with ghouls
  - Now able to keep playing after leader death
  - Leaders who can poison no longer wander away from their keep
- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush:

    - This will allow for dynamic adaptation to the situation on the map (to be implemented later)
  - Do not poison enemy if enemy could level up on its turn after being attacked

- ai_helper:
  - Added functions ai_helper.get_closest_location(), ai_helper.skip_CA(), ai_helper.has_ability()
  - ai_helper.movefull_stopunit(), ai_helper.move_unit_out_of_way(): now works also if unit cannot get there in one move
  - ai_helper.movefull_outofway_stopunit(): only move unit out of way if the approaching unit can actually get there
- Scale background image in campaign menu to avoid horizontal scroll bar
- Added GPL v2+ file (so that it is clear for the github site, mostly)


----- 0.10.5, 1 Sep 2012 -----

- Generic Rush
  - Replaced the generic grunt and elvish fighter rushes by a single version that can deal with all factions
    - Notes:

  - Changed day-time behavior (retreat) of rush on right:
    - Now set never to attack from dawn to afternoon
  - Poison attacks and attacks on weak enemies also have TOD-dependent threshold, but are not quite as exclusive
  - In addition, poison attacks have been de-prioritized at night, to free up units for rush on right

----- 0.10.2, 25 Aug 2012 -----

- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush:
  - Added new counter attack evaluation function
    -> Leader does now preferentially take villages when safe
    -> trapping attack is not done when expected counter attack damage is too high
  - Recruitment:
    - If leader goes village grabbing, recruit first (same as for attack_weak_enemy, but using different method)
    - If recruitment is done before end of turn, move units off castle if needed
  - Poisoner attacks: set up so that units move out of the way for poisoner and supporter


----- 0.10.1-b, 20 Aug 2012 -----

- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush:
  - Fixed a bug introduced by adding trapping attack to attack_weak_enemy() that eliminated some attacks from consideration
  - Lowered threshold of CTK for weak enemy attack
