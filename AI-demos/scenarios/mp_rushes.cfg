This campaign includes several experimental AIs (not just grunt rushes) that can be used in multiplayer mode. To play one of these AIs:
  - Go into the MP lobby (either local game or on the server)
  - Select either era or modification 'AI-demos Experimental AIs'
  - Select a map and options
  - Select 'Computer Player' for the AI side(s)
  - Select one of the new AIs
<i> </i>
Note:
- The AI called 'AI-demos: Ron â€” Generic Rush AI' has by now been added into mainline and is available there as 'Experimental AI'. The mainline and AI-Demos versions are not necessarily exactly the same as changes are first tested in AI-Demos and implemented in mainline later."}
