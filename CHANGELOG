0.11.3+
- Generic Rush:
  - Recruit algorithm:
    - Somewhat improved, though there are still glaring flaws
  - New castle switching CA:
    - Attempts to find castles closer to the action for recruiting and moves to them
    - Will use multiple castles to speed recruiting
    - Castles in Cynsaun Battlefield are too far apart for it to work there

0.11.3, 12 Oct 2012
- Original release of v0.11.3 for Wesnoth 1.11
  - Identical to v0.11.2, except for the "this is the last 1.10 release" messages

0.11.2, 12 Oct 2012
- ***** Important Note: This will be the last release of AI-Demos for Wesnoth 1.10 *****
  - Some of the next steps required at this point will only be possible with the new capabilities of BfW 1.11
  - Except for potential bug fixes, this will therefore be the last release of AI-Demos for Wesnoth 1.10
  - Further development will only be done for Wesnoth 1.11 and later; this will _not_ be backward compatible
  - We will make sure to use only capabilities of released versions of 1.11 (currently 1.11.0), so no compiling of trunk will be necessary
- Generic Rush:
  - New recruit algorithm, incl.:
    - Know about drain not affecting undead units
- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush:
  - New zone_control CA (completely reworked how several of the CAs function)
    - Works on a zone-by-zone basis, rather than map-wide
    - Several of the old CAs were combined into zone_control, acting in a more coordinated way (within a zone) in this way
    - This includes some changes to behavior, but nothing earth shattering
    - A bunch of bug fixes going along with that
    - Units are now sent into zones to capture villages, if there aren't enough units already
      - This is particularly important for the NW villages
    - Capturing of enemy-owned or unowned villages has higher priority on a zone-by-zone basis
  - Updated CA debugger
    - Now needs only a 1-turn initialization and turn number is reset afterward
    - New right-click option to let AI play through an entire turn
    - New right-click option to find the highest scoring CA
    - Simulation of self.data table as used by Fred during a turn
    - New right-click option to clear or show content of self.data table
    - Only show real evaluation functions in menu
    - Debugger now gives error message if used with Side 2 (instead of crashing Wesnoth)
    - Selected CA name is now shown in right-click menu

0.11.1, 6 Oct 2012
- Generic Rush:
  - New recruit algorithm
    - Can counter recruit
    - Recruits scouts based on map size
    - Can handle multiple allies and opponents
    - Should work with any faction (though non-standard abilities may not be accounted for or mishandled)
  - No longer freezes when trying to poison units with ghouls
  - Now able to keep playing after leader death
  - Leaders who can poison no longer wander away from their keep
- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush:
  - More refactoring, but so far only small changes to behavior

- Introduction of Micro AIs and the [micro_ai] tag
  - This includes a new scenario: Healer Support, which is the first to use the MAI functionality

    - Do not spread poison to undead units
    - Prefer to avoid poisoning units with magical ranged attacks
    - Improved turn 1 recruit vs undead
  - Increase aggressiveness if there's an enemy around the NW villages
  - Retreat seriously injured units toward villages, even if they are more than one move away
    - As part of that: retreat trolls toward mountains, not villages
  - Complete restructuring of the rush and hold/retreat CAs
    - This will allow for dynamic adaptation to the situation on the map (to be implemented later)
  - Do not poison enemy if enemy could level up on its turn after being attacked
  - Lots of refactoring and tuning of priorities and ratings
- ai_helper:
  - Added functions ai_helper.get_closest_location(), ai_helper.skip_CA(), ai_helper.has_ability()
  - ai_helper.movefull_stopunit(), ai_helper.move_unit_out_of_way(): now works also if unit cannot get there in one move
  - ai_helper.movefull_outofway_stopunit(): only move unit out of way if the approaching unit can actually get there
- Scale background image in campaign menu to avoid horizontal scroll bar
- Added GPL v2+ file (so that it is clear for the github site, mostly)

0.10.5, 1 Sep 2012
- Generic Rush
  - Replaced the generic grunt and elvish fighter rushes by a single version that can deal with all factions
    - Notes:
      - The functionality/behavior has not been updated, it's only been generalized

- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush:
  - Changed day-time behavior (retreat) of rush on right:
    - Now set never to attack from dawn to afternoon
  - Poison attacks and attacks on weak enemies also have TOD-dependent threshold, but are not quite as exclusive
  - In addition, poison attacks have been de-prioritized at night, to free up units for rush on right
  - Poisoner can now move next to AI unit that has attacked already (without need for additional support unit)
  - Combination attack evaluation on right was tuned (hopefully for the better)
  - Units that are out of reach for attacking on right advance more aggressively at night
  - Small change to recruiting: archers have somewhat higher priority now
  - Removed two unused CA dinosaurs
- All grunt rushes:
  - Added the AI's names (Fred, Ron, Ed) to the pop-up menu descriptions :D

0.10.2, 25 Aug 2012
- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush:
  - Added new counter attack evaluation function
    -> Leader does now preferentially take villages when safe
    -> trapping attack is not done when expected counter attack damage is too high
  - Recruitment:
    - If leader goes village grabbing, recruit first (same as for attack_weak_enemy, but using different method)
    - If recruitment is done before end of turn, move units off castle if needed
  - Poisoner attacks: set up so that units move out of the way for poisoner and supporter

0.10.1-b, 20 Aug 2012
- Freelands Side 1 Grunt Rush:
  - Fixed a bug introduced by adding trapping attack to attack_weak_enemy() that eliminated some attacks from consideration
  - Lowered threshold of CTK for weak enemy attack
