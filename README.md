Wesnoth AI Modification Demonstration Scenarios

NOTES:
* This add-on requires Wesnoth version 1.12.0 or later, but using the most recent stable version is recommended.
* If done manually, the add-on needs to be installed into ~add-ons/AI-demos/ or just download it from the Wesnoth add-ons server.

Home of the formidable Freelands AI, "Fred", and his little brother, the generic rushing AI "Ron"!

Many other Micro AIs were also developed in this add-on, but have now mostly been moved into mainline, such as:
* Animals
* Bottleneck Defense
* Goto
* Guardians
* Hang Out
* Healer Support
* Lurkers
* Messenger Escort
* Patrol
* Protect Unit
* Recruiting
* Simple Attack
