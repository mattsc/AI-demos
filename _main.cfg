    description=_"This is a collection of scenarios that demonstrate how the Wesnoth AI can be modified.  In addition to serving as templates for your own AI work, you can watch AI's with different behaviors fight it out, or take over one side to see how the new AI does against a human player.

<span color='#808080'><small>Version 0.10.1-b, 13(+2) scenarios with 30 different AI behaviors

Additional information is available under ""Practical Guide to Modifying AI Behavior"" on the Wesnoth wiki or in our thread on the Wesnoth forums: http://tinyurl.com/AI-mods</small></span>"
