    description=_"<u>AI Development and Demonstration Campaign</u>

Home of a number of AI development projects, most notably two MP AIs dubbed 'Ron' and 'Fred' as well as several test and demo scenarios.  This is also where the Micro AIs were developed.  As those have now been moved into mainline, they are no longer part of this campaign.

Fred currently boasts a >98% win rate against the RCA AI, but only on the Freelands map playing Northerners as Side 1.  He also still has significant problems playing against human players, so any comments on how to improve the AI would me most welcome.
