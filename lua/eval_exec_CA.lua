-- This is a collection of functions that can be used to evaluate and/or execute
-- individual candidate actions from the right-click menu
--
-- Required: 
-- 1. Wesnoth needs to be launched in debug mode, i.e. with the -d option
--    Activating debug mode later does not work (actually, that's e requirement for the
--    menu option to be set up in era.cfg, rather than for these functions here
-- 2. The MP game needs to be launched from the MP lobby
-- 3. The name of the CA to be tested needs to be set in function CA_name() below
--
-- Not required:
-- 1. Reloading after making changes, either to this file, or to Fred's engine functions
--    Just make the changes, save and the right-click should execute the changed version
-- 2. Launching game with Fred in control of Side 1
--    Only thing required is that era 'Default+Experimental AI' is used

    -- This function sets the name of the CA to be executed or evaluated
