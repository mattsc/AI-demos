-- Function to perform fast evaluation of attacks and attack combinations.
-- The emphasis with all of this is on speed, not elegance.
-- This might result in redundant information being produced/passed and similar.
-- Note to self: working with Lua tables is generally much faster than with unit proxy tables.
-- Also, creating tables takes time, indexing by number is faster than by sting, etc.
