This campaign includes several ""grunt rush"" AI's that can be used in multiplayer mode.  To do so:
- Go into the MP lobby (either local game or on the server)
- Select era: Default+Experimental AI
- Select the Freelands map
- For Side 1, select 'Computer Player', then 'Experimental Grunt Rush for Freelands, Side 1' from the list of available AI's
- Select Northerners for the faction
- Start the game with your choice of faction for Side 2 (except Undead)
 
Notes:
- There is also an AI called 'Experimental Grunt Rush AI' that can be used with any side, on any map, but still only with Northerners
- 'Experimental Grunt Rush AI with Elvish Fighters' is a variation thereof that works with the Rebels faction"}
