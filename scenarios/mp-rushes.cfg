This campaign includes several experimental AIs that can be used in multiplayer mode.  To play one of these AIs:
  - Go into the MP lobby (either local game or on the server)
  - Select era: Default+Experimental AI
  - Select a map and options
  - Select 'Computer Player' for the AI side(s)
  - Select one of the new AIs

Note:
- The AI called 'ExpAI Ron: Generic Rush (any map)' has by now been added into mainline and is available there as 'Experimental AI'.  The mainline and AI-Demos versions are not necessarily exactly the same as changes are first tested in AI-Demos and implemented in mainline later."}
