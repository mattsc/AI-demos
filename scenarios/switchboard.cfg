            story= _ "<span font='16'>Hi, I'm Grnk the Frail. You may remember me from such instructional campaigns as 'Grnk the Mighty' and 'Why You Shouldn't Attack Peasants When There's A Mad Goblin Around.'

This is where the Micro AIs were developed.  As those have now been moved into mainline, they are no longer part of this campaign.  Instead, it now contains a couple MP AIs under development (dubbed 'Ron' and 'Fred') as well as several test and demo scenarios.

Fred currently boasts a >98% win rate against the RCA AI, but only on the Freelands map playing Northerners as Side 1.  He also still has significant problems playing against human players, so any comments on how to improve the AI would me most welcome.

In general, if you have comments, problems, suggestions or requests for additional AI behaviors, please visit our thread on the <span color='#00A000'>Wesnoth forums</span> at http://tinyurl.com/AI-mods</span>" # wmllint: no spellcheck
