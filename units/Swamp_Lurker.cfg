    description=_"Swamp Lurkers are elusive creatures that are uniquely adapted to their wet and muddy environment.  They are capable of hiding from all but the closest enemies, and even right next to them you will only ever see their eyes.  They are capable of moving across most any terrain, but will never stop on anything other than swamps.

Special Notes:  In swamps, this unit's adaptation renders it invisible to enemies unless it is immediately adjacent or has revealed itself by attacking."
